#FSK Serial Generator
##in JavaScript for SoftModem breakout board


###Info

You can send data to the SoftModem breakout board for Arduino using JavaScript in this page.  
This works in data-uri audio and HTML5 ready browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera).  

For mobile browsers (on iOS or Android Devices), you can use the Download Audio file button (because mobile browsers do not support dataURIs).
